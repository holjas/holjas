# Hello. I'm Holly. 👋 
I began my work life in hospitality. After many years in the industry, I became bored to death with corporate action plans and financial statements, so I jumped ship to learn web development. 📚 My passion for self-education and curiosity of technology led me to the vast arena of online coding courses. 💻  I consider myself a self-starter and as such, I believe that the best learning happens by doing.

Craving a collaborative learning environment to compliment my self-acquired skills and to gain some guidance from humans in the field, I enrolled in the Web Dev bootcamp with Juno College to round out my web-dev education (and gain some real person connections).✨ 

I'm a problem solver at heart with a knack for communicating well with other humans, plus I have a secret jones for design and colour.🌈 
My mantra is “be patient and keep going”. I also like to make things out of wool. 🧣

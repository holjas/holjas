<h1> Hello! I'm Holly 👋 </h1>

<h3>🖥️  <em>Front-End Developer in Toronto, Canada</em> 🍁</h3>
------------------------
<br/>
<p>I am a collaborative front-end web developer with an eye for detail and a way with words. I am well versed in a number of languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, React, Sass and Bootstrap to name a few…</p>

<p>I have years of experience in the hospitality industry that have molded me into a great team player with a real knack for communicating with folks.  I find it easy to understand what someone is trying to convey and keep a positive attitude during times of uncertainty and stress. </p>

<p>I’m super excited to utilize my skills to build inclusive, creative, intuitive and clean applications that can be enjoyed by everyone! 🌈 ✅ 🖌️</p>

<p>🙏 My mantra is “be patient and keep going”. I also like to make things out of wool. 🧣</p>
